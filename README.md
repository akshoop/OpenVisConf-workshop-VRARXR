# VISUALIZE YOUR DATA IN A 3D VR WORLD USING A-FRAME IN WEBVR
Wednesday, 16 May, 2018, Morning (9 - 12h30)
We will go over the basic concepts of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and WebVR first. Then we will start creating very basic WebVR applications. Once we have the basics under our toolbelt, I will demonstrate how you can use the same concepts to create more complex scenes and how navigation and interaction design will be possible in WebVR using A-Frame.

Once everyone has a grasp of WebVR and A-Frame content creation, we will move into data visualization: Showing what kinds of data formats we can use, where we can host them, and how we can display them inside the WebVR scene. We will utilize A-Frame as well as D3.js's capabilities for that. We also will explore ways to interact with data in VR.
